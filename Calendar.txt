Index.html
1) <meta charset="UTF-8">
In other words, <meta charset="utf-8"> tells the browser to use the utf-8 character encoding when translating machine code into human-readable text and
vice versa to be displayed in the browser.

2) <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

3) <link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css">
The REL attribute is used to define the relationship between the linked file and the HTML document. REL=StyleSheet specifies a persistent or preferred style.

App.js
1) let calendar = document.querySelector('.calendar')
The Let Keyword allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used,
The Document method querySelector() returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors.
If no matches are found, null is returned.

2) const month_names = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
The const keyword specifies that a variable's value is constant and tells the compiler to prevent the programmer from modifying it.
